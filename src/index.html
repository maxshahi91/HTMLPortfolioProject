  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I've always been really keen about web development. I have recently decided to spend an extensive amount of time to get a stronger understanding of the general development lifecycle and different development methodologies. I believe I am fluent in html and css however plenty of room to grow. I have spent the recent weeks learning more about Javascript both front & back end however currently only focusing on front-end so that I have one thing to focus on at a time.</p>

  <h3>My Skills</h3>
  <p>Below are languages I have a keen interest in.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
